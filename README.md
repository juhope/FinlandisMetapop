This repository contains the simulation code for the paper "Estimation of metapopulation colonization rates from disturbance history and occurrence pattern data" by Fabritius et al. for the purpose of documenting the methods used for the study.

Directory "Fin-Landis" contains the C++ source code for a version of FIN-LANDIS forest landscape simulation model used for the study (He and Mladenoff 1999, Mladenoff and He 1999, Pennanen and Kuuluvainen 2002). The ouput of the forest landscape simulation is used as input for the epiphyte metapopulation simulation.

Directory "Metapop" contains the C++ source code for the metapopulation simulator described in the paper.

The C++ code of the simulation models can be readily compiled with Embarcadero C++ Builder 10 which is available for free.
